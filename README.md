ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Paul

I am a web development enthusiast based in Manitoba, Canada.

Currently learning various web development technologies such as React, React-hooks, GraphQL, Performance, Docker, Redux, Code Splitting, Progressive Web Apps, Testing Apps, TypeScript, SPA, Server side rendering, AWS, Security, Redos, and more.

I am particularly interested in building an e-commerce app using React, React-hooks, and Firebase, and you can check out my progress on [Crwn-Clothing](https://github.com/alcoranpaul/crwn-clothing).

Aside from web development, I am also interested in exploring other areas such as machine learning, Arduino, and game development in Unreal Engine. I am always eager to learn and explore new technologies, so feel free to share any resources or tips you may have!

Lastly, I am proud to be Filipino and I enjoy sharing my culture with others. If you have any questions or just want to chat, don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks for stopping by!
